1. Initialize shared buffer shbff
2. Initialize semaphores:
   - empty = 1 (buffer is available)
   - full = 0 (buffer is empty)

3. Producer Thread:
   Loop forever:
      a. Wait on empty semaphore
      b. Get input from user into shbff
      c. Signal full semaphore

4. Consumer Thread:
   Loop forever:
      a. Wait on full semaphore
      b. Read and display message from shbff
      c. Signal empty semaphore

5. In main():
   a. Initialize semaphores
   b. Create producer and consumer threads
   c. Wait for threads to complete (infinite loop)

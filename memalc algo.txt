1. Input nb (number of blocks), np (number of processes)
2. Input the size of each block and store in blk[] array.
3. Input the size of each process and store in proc[] array.

4. Display choices:
   a. 0 - Exit
   b. 1 - First Fit
   c. 2 - Best Fit

5. Loop until the user selects option 0 to exit:
   a. If choice is 1 (First Fit):
      i. For each process:
         - Search for the first block that fits the process size.
         - If a block is found, allocate it and update the block size.
         - If no block can accommodate, mark process as not allocated.
      ii. Display the allocation result.
   
   b. If choice is 2 (Best Fit):
      i. For each process:
         - Search for the best block that fits the process size with the least remaining space.
         - If a block is found, allocate it and update the block size.
         - If no block can accommodate, mark process as not allocated.
      ii. Display the allocation result.

6. Repeat the process until the user selects 0 to exit.
